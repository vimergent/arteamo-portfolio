# Session Summary - January 1, 2025

## Overview
This session focused on security improvements and CMS planning for the Studio Arteamo portfolio website.

## Changes Made

### 1. Security Audit & SSH Configuration
**Task**: Performed security audit and disabled SSH password authentication

**Changes**:
- Conducted comprehensive security audit of the codebase
- Found no critical security vulnerabilities (no exposed credentials, API keys, or secrets)
- Modified `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:
  - Set `PasswordAuthentication no`
  - Set `PubkeyAuthentication yes`
  - Set `PermitRootLogin prohibit-password`
  - Set `PermitEmptyPasswords no`
- Created `/root/setup-ssh-keys.sh` script for SSH key management
- Restarted SSH service to apply changes

**Result**: SSH access now requires key-based authentication only

### 2. CLAUDE.md Improvements
**Task**: Analyzed codebase and updated CLAUDE.md file

**Changes**:
- Created improved `/root/Interiori/CLAUDE.md` with:
  - Clear development commands
  - Project structure overview
  - Testing approach
  - List of 11 project folders
  - Currently implemented websites (8/15)

### 3. Random Gallery Feature for website1-minimalist
**Task**: Add automatic random gallery under "Creating Spaces That Inspire" section

**Changes**:
- Modified `/root/Interiori/websites/website1-minimalist/index.html`:
  - Added gallery container in hero section (lines 44-49)

### 4. CMS Implementation Planning
**Task**: Create comprehensive plan for adding CMS functionality

**Files Created**:
1. `/root/Interiori/CMS_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`:
   - Architecture options (Serverless vs Traditional)
   - Database schema (projects, images, users, settings)
   - API endpoints specification
   - Implementation phases (6-8 weeks)
   - Cost estimation (~$80/month)
   - Security considerations
   - Migration strategy

2. `/root/Interiori/CMS_TECHNICAL_SPEC.md`:
   - Admin interface mockups (ASCII art)
   - Netlify CMS configuration example
   - API client implementation
   - Progressive enhancement strategy
   - Security middleware examples
   - Migration scripts
   - Performance optimization tips

**Recommendations**:

- Long-term: Build custom serverless CMS (6-8 weeks)

## Important Context for Future Sessions

### Current State:
- Static site with 15 variations (8 completed, 7 in development)
- 11 interior design projects with 165 total images
- Random gallery active on website1-minimalist
- SSH configured for key-only access
- CMS planning complete, ready for implementation

### Next Steps:
1. Get client approval for CMS approach
2. Implement Netlify CMS as quick win
3. Begin custom CMS development if needed
4. Migrate existing projects to CMS
5. Update all 15 website variations

### Key Files to Review:
- `/root/Interiori/CLAUDE.md` - Development guide
- `/root/Interiori/CMS_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Strategic plan
- `/root/Interiori/CMS_TECHNICAL_SPEC.md` - Technical details
- `/root/Interiori/websites/website1-minimalist/index.html` - Random gallery implementation

### Testing Commands:
```bash
cd /root/Interiori/websites
python3 serve.py  # Start dev server on port 8090
node test-random-gallery.js  # Test gallery functionality
node test-comprehensive.js  # Full test suite
```

### 5. Gallery Bug Fix - Chayka District Project
**Issue**: Images not displaying for "Apartament Кв. Чайка, Варна_2017" project
**URL**: http://31.97.139.39:8090/gallery-premium.html?project=Apartament%20%D0%9A%D0%B2.%20%D0%A7%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%BA%D0%B0%2C%20%D0%92%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B0_2017

**Root Cause**: Project was missing from projectData object in gallery-premium.html

**Fix Applied**:
- Modified `/root/Interiori/websites/gallery-premium.html`
- Added missing project definition at line 895-902:
```javascript
'Apartament Кв. Чайка, Варна_2017': {
    name: 'Chayka District',
    subtitle: 'Family Living',
    description: 'A warm family home balancing traditional charm with modern convenience, located in the heart of Chayka district.',
    year: '2017',
    area: '85m²',
    images: ['Dnevna01.jpg', 'Dnevna02.jpg', 'Dnevna04.jpg', 'Fotev (2).jpg', 'Fotev (3).jpg', 'Fotev (5).jpg']
}
```

**Testing**:
- Created `test-chayka-gallery.js` to verify fix
- All 6 images now loading correctly
- Gallery displays proper project info (2017, 85m²)
- Lightbox functionality working

### 6. Centralized Project Configuration System
**Issue**: Projects missing from galleries, data duplicated across files
**Missing Projects Found**: 
- "Playground Grand Mall Varna 2018" was not in gallery-premium.html
- Risk of future projects being missed

**Solution Implemented**:
1. Created `/root/Interiori/websites/project-config.js`
   - Central configuration for all 11 projects
   - Multi-language support (BG, EN, RU, ES)
   - Complete metadata and image lists
   - Single source of truth

2. Updated gallery system:
   - Modified `gallery-premium.html` (lines 832-852) to use dynamic config
   - Removed hardcoded projectData (lines 853-941)
   - Modified `website1-minimalist/index.html` to use centralized config

3. Benefits:
   - No more missing projects
   - Easy to add new projects (one place)
   - Consistent data across all sites
   - Automatic multi-language support

**Testing**:
- Created `test-all-project-galleries.js`
- All 11 projects tested successfully
- 165 total images verified
- No 404 errors

**Documentation**:
- Created `PROJECT_CONFIG_DOCUMENTATION.md` with full details

### 7. Studio Name Correction
**Issue**: About section showed "About Studio" instead of "About Studio Arteamo"

**Fix Applied**:
- Modified `/root/Interiori/websites/translations.js`
  - Line 29: `"About Studio"` → `"About Studio Arteamo"`
  - Line 464, 1780: `"За студиото"` → `"За Студио Артеамо"`
  - Line 899: `"О студии"` → `"О Студио Артеамо"`
  - Line 1334: `"Sobre el estudio"` → `"Sobre Studio Arteamo"`

**Result**: All languages now show full studio name in About section

### 8. Awards Links Implementation
**Issue**: Awards were plain text without links to learn more

**Solution Implemented**:
1. Modified `/root/Interiori/websites/translations.js`
   - Added `award1_link`, `award2_link`, `award3_link` fields for all languages
   - Set Ideal Standard link for award3: `https://www.idealstandard.com`
   - Links for awards 1 & 2 left empty (to be added when available)

2. Created `/root/Interiori/websites/awards-handler.js`
   - Dynamic awards display with optional links
   - Automatic language switching support
   - Opens links in new tab with security attributes

3. Updated `/root/Interiori/websites/website1-minimalist/index.html`
   - Added `data-awards="true"` attribute (line 238)
   - Included awards-handler.js script (line 300)

4. Enhanced `/root/Interiori/websites/language-switcher-v2.js`
   - Added languageChanged event dispatch (line 199)
   - Enables dynamic content updates on language switch

**Result**: Award 3 (Ideal Standard) now has clickable link, others ready for links when available

### 9. Added Permanent Development Rules
**Task**: Establish critical rules for all future development

**Changes Made**:
- Updated `/root/Interiori/CLAUDE.md` with three permanent rules:
  1. **Documentation Rule** - Session summaries requirement (already existed)
  2. **Holistic Analysis Rule** - Analyze changes in full project context
  3. **Version Control Rule** - Use GitHub for commits and versioning

**Purpose**: 
- Prevent breaking changes by enforcing comprehensive analysis
- Enable easy rollback through proper version control
- Ensure sustainable development practices
