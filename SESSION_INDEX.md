2. **Random gallery feature** is the current focus - experiencing display issues
3. **Image paths** use symbolic link: `../projects/[folder]/[image]`
4. **Multi-language support** is fully functional (6 languages)
5. **Always commit with descriptive messages** before major changes

## Current Issues Being Addressed
