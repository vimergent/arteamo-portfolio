# Domain Configuration - IMPORTANT

## Current Setup (as of 2025-01-05)

### Primary Domain
- **Domain**: arteamo.net
- **DNS Configuration**: Using Netlify DNS servers
- **Status**: DNS servers added to domain registrar
- **Expected Propagation**: 24-48 hours

### Netlify Deployment
- **Netlify URL**: https://studio-arteamo.netlify.app
- **Site Name**: studio-arteamo
- **Auto-deploys**: Enabled from GitHub master branch

### Important Notes
1. User has configured arteamo.net to use Netlify DNS servers at their domain registrar
2. DNS propagation may take 24-48 hours
3. Netlify will automatically provision SSL certificate once DNS propagates
4. CNAME file in repository is set to "arteamo.net"
5. Both arteamo.net and studio-arteamo.netlify.app will show the same site once DNS propagates

### What Happens Next
- Netlify will detect the domain and configure it automatically
- SSL certificate will be provisioned
- Both www.arteamo.net and arteamo.net will work
- All traffic will be served from Netlify's CDN

### For Future Claude Instances
- Remember that arteamo.net is the primary domain
- The site is hosted on Netlify, not on a separate server
- Any deployments to GitHub master branch will update both URLs
- If DNS issues arise, check Netlify dashboard for domain status
