# Web Deployment Plan for Studio Arteamo Portfolio Showcase

## Overview
I've created a portfolio showcase with 5 different website designs for Studio Arteamo. Here's my plan to get them online for you to access from anywhere.

## Current Status
- âœ… Website 1: Modern Minimalist - **READY**
- âœ… Website 2: Dark Luxury - **READY**
- ðŸš§ Website 3: Magazine Editorial - In Progress

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: GitHub Pages (FREE - Recommended)
**Pros:**
- Completely free
- Easy to set up

- Custom domain support (if you want arteamo.net subdomain)
- Automatic HTTPS/SSL

**Process:**
1. Create a GitHub account (if you don't have one)
2. Create a new repository
3. Upload the websites folder
4. Enable GitHub Pages in settings
5. Access via: `https://[your-username].github.io/arteamo-portfolio`

**Time to Deploy:** 15-20 minutes

### Option 2: Netlify (FREE with Premium Options)
**Pros:**
- Free tier is generous
- Drag-and-drop deployment
- Automatic HTTPS
- Form handling included
- Fast global CDN

**Process:**
1. Create Netlify account
2. Drag the websites folder to Netlify
3. Get instant URL like: `https://arteamo-portfolio.netlify.app`
4. Optional: Connect custom domain

**Time to Deploy:** 5-10 minutes

---

### Option 3: Vercel (FREE with Premium Options)
**Pros:**
- Excellent performance
- Free SSL
- Global edge network
- Easy deployment

**Process:**
1. Create Vercel account
2. Import project
3. Deploy with one click
4. Access via: `https://arteamo-portfolio.vercel.app`

**Time to Deploy:** 10-15 minutes

---

### Option 4: Surge.sh (FREE)
**Pros:**
- Super simple command-line deployment
- Free custom domains
- No account needed initially

**Process:**
1. Install surge: `npm install -g surge`
2. Run: `surge /root/Interiori/websites`

4. Access immediately

**Time to Deploy:** 2-5 minutes

---

### Option 5: Traditional Web Hosting
**If you already have hosting with your arteamo.net domain:**

**Process:**
1. Create a subdomain (e.g., `showcase.arteamo.net`)
2. Upload via FTP/cPanel
3. Point subdomain to the websites folder

**Time to Deploy:** 30-45 minutes

---

## My Recommendation

**For immediate access: Netlify**
- Fastest to set up
- No technical knowledge required
- Professional URL options
- Can be done right now

**For long-term professional use: GitHub Pages + Custom Domain**
- Most reliable
- Version control included
- Professional appearance with custom domain

---

## Next Steps

Please let me know which option you prefer, and I can:

1. **Guide you through the setup process step-by-step**
2. **Prepare the files for deployment** (optimize images, minify code)
3. **Set up the deployment for you** (if you provide account details)
4. **Create deployment scripts** for easy updates

## Additional Considerations

- All options support custom domains if you want to use a subdomain of arteamo.net
- The websites use relative paths, so they'll work on any hosting
- Total size is manageable (mainly images from your projects)
- No backend/database required - these are static sites
