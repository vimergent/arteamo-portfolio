## Gallery Template Features

The universal gallery template (`gallery-template.html`) includes:
- Responsive grid layout
- Lightbox with keyboard navigation
- Back button to return to origin website
- Support for all 11 project folders
- Automatic image loading based on project selection

## How It Works

1. User clicks on a project card/element
2. JavaScript function constructs gallery URL with parameters:
   - `project`: The folder name
   - `name`: Display name for the gallery
   - `from`: Return path to original website
3. Gallery template loads and displays all project images
4. User can browse images, use lightbox, and return to portfolio

## Next Steps

To complete the remaining 7 websites, the same pattern needs to be applied:
1. Add onclick handlers to project elements
2. Include openProjectGallery JavaScript function
3. Ensure cursor:pointer styling
