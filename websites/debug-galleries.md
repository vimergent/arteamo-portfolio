# Gallery Issues on Netlify - Diagnosis & Solutions

## üîç Issues Found:

### 1. **Click Functionality Not Working**
The JavaScript IS implemented but may not be executing because:
- Script loading order issues
- Missing event listeners
- Console errors preventing execution

### 2. **Images May Not Be Loading**
Using relative paths `../` which means:
- From `/website1-minimalist/` it looks for images at root level
- Images should be at `/Apartament Flavia Garden 2024/cam01.jpg`

## üîß Quick Fixes to Try:

### Fix 1: Check Browser Console
1. Open https://studioarteamo.netlify.app/website1-minimalist/
2. Press F12 (Developer Tools)
3. Go to Console tab
4. Look for red errors
5. Go to Network tab
6. Reload page and look for 404 errors (red items)

### Fix 2: Test Direct Image Access
Try these URLs directly:
- https://studioarteamo.netlify.app/Apartament%20Flavia%20Garden%202024/cam01.jpg
- https://studioarteamo.netlify.app/Elite%20Clinic%202021/Cam09.jpg

If these don't work, the image folders weren't deployed.

### Fix 3: Test Click Functionality
1. Open any website (1-4)
2. Click on a project card
3. A modal should appear with project details
4. If nothing happens, check console for errors

## üö® Likely Root Cause:

The image folders might not have been included in the Git repository due to:
- File size limits
- .gitignore rules
- Git LFS requirements

## üí° Solution:

### Option 1: Check Git Status
```bash
git ls-files | grep -E "\.jpg|\.bmp" | wc -l
```
This shows how many images are in the repository.

### Option 2: Use Git LFS for Images
```bash
git lfs track "*.jpg"
git lfs track "*.bmp"
git add .gitattributes
git add -A
git commit -m "Add Git LFS for images"
git push
```

### Option 3: Image Optimization
Compress images before committing:
- Use online tools or scripts
- Reduce file sizes
- Maintain quality

### Option 4: External Image Hosting
- Upload images to Cloudinary/Imgur
- Update paths in HTML
- Faster loading times
