# Persistent TODO System Documentation

## Overview
Created a file-based TODO system to prevent task loss between sessions. The in-memory todo context gets lost when sessions are interrupted or stopped.

## Files Created

### 1. TODO.md
- Main todo list file that persists across sessions
- Organized by priority levels (High/Medium/Low)
- Includes completed tasks section
- Tracks completion dates

### 2. todo-manager.js
Command-line tool for managing todos:

```bash
# List all todos
node todo-manager.js list

# Add a new todo
node todo-manager.js add "Task description" --high
node todo-manager.js add "Another task" --medium
node todo-manager.js add "Low priority task" --low

# Complete a todo
node todo-manager.js complete "Task description"
```

### 3. TODO_HISTORY.md
- Archive for completed tasks
- Auto-created when using todo-manager.js
- Keeps TODO.md clean by archiving old completed tasks

## Why This System?

The built-in TodoRead/TodoWrite tools only store tasks in memory/context, which means:
- Tasks are lost when the session ends
- No persistence between conversations
- Can't recover tasks after interruptions

This file-based system ensures:
- ✅ Tasks persist between sessions
- ✅ History is maintained
- ✅ Can be version controlled with git
- ✅ Human-readable format
- ✅ Can be edited manually or via CLI

## Usage Recommendation

1. **For Claude/AI**: Continue using TodoRead/TodoWrite for immediate task tracking
2. **For Persistence**: Regularly sync important tasks to TODO.md
3. **For History**: Use todo-manager.js to properly archive completed tasks
