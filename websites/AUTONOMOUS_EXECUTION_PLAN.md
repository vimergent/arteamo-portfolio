# Autonomous Execution Plan - 7 Websites Build

## Execution Strategy
Work continuously on all 7 websites, handling blockers by:
1. If blocked on one site, move to next
2. Create simplified versions first, enhance later
3. Test and fix all issues before marking complete
4. Commit each completed site to GitHub
5. Document any permission needs for later

## Build Order (by complexity)
1. **Website 11 - Japandi** (Astro, minimal JS) - SIMPLEST
2. **Website 13 - Retro** (Three.js visuals) - VISUAL FOCUSED
3. **Website 14 - Zen** (GSAP animations) - ANIMATION HEAVY
4. **Website 15 - ASCII** (Terminal interface) - UNIQUE UX
5. **Website 9 - Makeover** (React SPA) - FRAMEWORK HEAVY
6. **Website 10 - Magazine** (WordPress/Next.js) - MOST COMPLEX
7. **Website 12 - Bulgarian** (Nuxt 3) - CULTURAL ELEMENTS

## Approach for Each Site

### Phase 1: Core Structure (All Sites)
- Create index.html with proper structure
- Implement responsive CSS
- Add project data and images
- Basic navigation

### Phase 2: Framework/Features
- Add framework-specific features where possible
- Implement vanilla JS alternatives if frameworks unavailable
- Create progressive enhancement approach

### Phase 3: Testing & Polish
- Test all functionality
- Fix responsive issues
- Optimize performance
- Add fallbacks

## Handling Blockers

### If Framework Unavailable:
- React → Vanilla JS with similar component structure
- Next.js → Static HTML with JS enhancements
- Nuxt → Vue-like vanilla implementation
- Astro → Ultra-minimal static build

### If Feature Complex:
- Three.js → CSS3D transforms
- Framer Motion → CSS animations
- WordPress API → Mock JSON data
- Build tools → Manual optimization

## Success Criteria
- All 7 sites have working index.html
- All sites display portfolio projects
- Responsive design works
- Core features implemented (even simplified)
- No console errors
- Committed to GitHub

## Start Time: 2025-06-27
## Target: Complete as many as possible autonomously
