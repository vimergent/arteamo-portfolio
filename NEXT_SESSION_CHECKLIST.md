# Next Session Checklist - Session #4

## CRITICAL: Start Here
1. Read this checklist first
2. Check session order: `node /root/Interiori/manage-sessions.js list`
3. Read previous session: `cat /root/Interiori/SESSION_SUMMARY_2025-01-02.md`

## Current State
- **Session #3 Status**: INCOMPLETE - Gallery showing white squares
- **Uncommitted Changes**: Gallery fixes in index.html and styles-enhanced.css
- **DO NOT COMMIT** until user confirms gallery is working

## Active Issues
1. Random gallery shows white squares instead of images
2. Images appear briefly then disappear
3. Mobile version may not load past initial page

## What's Already Been Tried
- ✅ Created symbolic link: `projects` → `/root/Interiori`
- ✅ Fixed image paths to use `../projects/[folder]/[image]`
- ✅ Disabled auto-refresh (was causing issues)
- ✅ Removed CSS animations (were hiding images)
- ✅ Simplified gallery code
- ❌ Gallery still not displaying correctly

## Test URLs Available
- Main site: http://[IP]:8090/website1-minimalist/
- Test pages:
  - test-simple.html
  - debug-gallery.html
  - test-image.html

## Next Steps
1. Continue debugging why images disappear after loading
2. Check browser console for any new errors
3. Test if images load without the gallery JavaScript
4. Consider creating a minimal version to isolate the issue
5. Get user approval before committing any fixes

## Important Context
- Only website1-minimalist is being developed
- All other website variations are archived
- User emphasized mobile performance is critical
- Session management system now in place for continuity

## Commands to Start
```bash
# Check current directory
pwd

# Start development server if needed
cd /root/Interiori/websites && python3 -m http.server 8090 &

# Check git status for uncommitted changes
git status

# View current gallery code
cat /root/Interiori/websites/website1-minimalist/index.html | grep -A20 "createGalleryWithImages"
```

Remember: Document everything in the new session summary!
