# Debugging Team Analysis - Redirect Loop Root Cause
**Date**: January 5, 2025  
**Team**: Network Engineer, DevOps Specialist, Frontend Developer, DNS Expert

## Executive Summary
The redirect loop issue on arteamo.net is caused by a hidden `.netlify/netlify.toml` configuration file that overrides the main configuration, keeping Edge Functions active despite attempts to disable them.

## Detailed Analysis by Expert

### Network Engineer Analysis
**Finding**: Infinite redirect loops occurring at the CDN edge layer

**Evidence**:
- HTTP requests show 302 redirects with query parameters
- Pattern: `/image.jpg` → `/image.jpg?q=85&fm=webp` → redirect loop
- Edge Function at path `/*` intercepts ALL requests
- No escape condition for already-processed URLs

**Impact**: 
- ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS for all image assets
- Site unusable on production domain
- CDN continuously processing same requests

### DevOps Specialist Analysis
**Finding**: Configuration conflict between multiple netlify.toml files

**Evidence**:
```
/websites/netlify.toml (main - Edge Functions commented out)
/websites/.netlify/netlify.toml (hidden - Edge Functions ACTIVE)
```

**Root Cause**:
1. Netlify CLI generates `.netlify/` directory
2. Contains auto-generated netlify.toml that overrides main config
3. This file is not visible in normal git operations
4. Deployment uses hidden config, ignoring main file changes

**Solution Path**:
```bash
# Remove conflicting configuration
rm -rf /root/Interiori/websites/.netlify/

# Add to .gitignore
echo ".netlify/" >> .gitignore

# Force clean deployment
git add -A && git commit -m "fix: remove netlify CLI artifacts"
git push origin master
```

### Frontend Developer Analysis
**Finding**: Multiple layers of redirect rules creating complexity

**Issues Identified**:
1. **File Structure Mismatch**:
   - Content moved to root but redirects still reference `/website1-minimalist/`
   - Two index.html files exist (root and subdirectory)

2. **JavaScript Workarounds**:
   - Had to implement client-side image URL cleaning
   - Not a proper solution - just masks the problem
   - Performance impact from intercepting all image loads

3. **Asset Loading**:
   - Images requested with optimization parameters
   - Parameters cause Edge Function to process again
   - No way to mark images as "already optimized"

### DNS Expert Analysis
**Finding**: DNS configuration is correct - not a DNS issue

**Verification**:
- arteamo.net properly configured with Netlify nameservers
- DNS resolution working correctly
- studio-arteamo.netlify.app functioning properly
- Issue only occurs on custom domain due to Edge Function behavior

**DNS Records Status**:
- A record: Points to Netlify
- CNAME: Properly configured
- SSL: Certificate provisioned
- **Conclusion**: DNS is not the cause

    Netlify Edge (Global)
            ↓
    Edge Function Check

            ↓
    Pattern Match: /* (matches everything)

    302 Redirect to: arteamo.net/image.jpg?q=85&fm=webp
            ↓
    [LOOP BEGINS - Same Edge Function triggers again]
```

## Comprehensive Solution Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate Fix (5 minutes)
1. **Remove Hidden Config**:
   ```bash
   cd /root/Interiori/websites
   rm -rf .netlify/
   ```

2. **Update .gitignore**:
   ```bash
   echo ".netlify/" >> .gitignore
   ```

3. **Deploy Clean Version**:
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "fix: remove Netlify CLI artifacts causing redirect loops"
   git push origin master
   ```

### Phase 2: Verify Fix (10 minutes)
1. Check Netlify dashboard → Functions tab
2. Ensure no Edge Functions listed
3. Test image loading on arteamo.net
4. Remove client-side workarounds if successful

### Phase 3: Prevent Recurrence (ongoing)
1. **Never run `netlify dev` or `netlify init` in production code**
2. **Always check for .netlify/ directory before commits**
3. **Use Netlify dashboard for configuration, not CLI**
4. **Document this issue prominently**

## Alternative Solutions (if main fix fails)

### Option A: Explicit Edge Function Disable
Add to main netlify.toml:
```toml
[functions]
  edge_functions = []  # Explicitly empty

[build.processing]
  skip_processing = true
```

### Option B: Different Domain Configuration
- Use Netlify subdomain as primary
- Set up domain forwarding instead of DNS

### Option C: Migration Path
- Move to different hosting if Edge Functions can't be disabled
- Consider Vercel, GitHub Pages, or Cloudflare Pages

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] .netlify/ directory removed
- [ ] Changes committed and pushed
- [ ] Netlify deployment completed
- [ ] No Edge Functions in dashboard
- [ ] Images load without parameters on arteamo.net
- [ ] Client-side fixes can be removed
- [ ] Both domains work identically

## Lessons Learned
1. **Hidden configuration files can override visible ones**
2. **Netlify CLI artifacts should not be committed**
3. **Edge Functions on /* pattern are dangerous**
4. **Always verify configuration in deployment dashboard**
5. **Client-side fixes indicate server-side problems**

## Final Recommendation
The team unanimously agrees: **Delete the .netlify/ directory** and redeploy. This single action should resolve all redirect loop issues.
