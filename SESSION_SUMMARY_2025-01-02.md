# Session Summary - January 2, 2025

## Overview
This session focused on improving the random gallery feature in website1-minimalist to eliminate white/blank spaces during refresh, particularly on mobile devices.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Updated Project Documentation (CLAUDE.md)
- Marked all website variations (2-15) as ARCHIVED
- Documented that only website1-minimalist will receive continued development
- This clarifies the project scope going forward

### 2. Random Gallery Improvements (index.html & styles-enhanced.css)

#### JavaScript Changes:
- **Seamless Crossfade Transitions**: Implemented dual-container approach that creates new gallery behind current one, then crossfades
- **Image Preloading**: Added `preloadImages()` function to ensure all images are loaded before display
- **Smart Refresh Timing**: Added user interaction tracking to pause refresh during active viewing
- **Async Gallery Creation**: Converted to `createGalleryWithImages()` async function for better control

#### CSS Enhancements:
- **Skeleton Loading States**: Added animated gradient background while images load
- **Container Stability**: Added `min-height` to prevent layout collapse during transitions
- **Mobile Optimization**: 
  - Kept 2-column grid even on small screens (previously 1 column)
  - Changed to square aspect ratio on mobile for better space usage
  - Reduced gaps and font sizes for mobile
  - Increased min-height on mobile to prevent empty space

#### Technical Implementation:
- Removed 500ms blank period between refreshes
- Changed from opacity fade-out/clear/fade-in to seamless crossfade
- Images marked with 'loaded' class when ready
- Used `will-change: opacity` for performance optimization
- Changed loading attribute from 'lazy' to 'eager' for preloaded images

## Files Modified
1. `/root/Interiori/CLAUDE.md` - Updated development focus
2. `/root/Interiori/websites/website1-minimalist/index.html` - Improved gallery JavaScript
3. `/root/Interiori/websites/website1-minimalist/styles-enhanced.css` - Enhanced gallery CSS

## Results
- Eliminated white/blank spaces during gallery refresh
- Smoother user experience with seamless transitions
- Better mobile layout with consistent 2-column grid
- Improved performance with preloading and optimized transitions
- Smart refresh that respects user interaction

## Git Status
- All changes committed with descriptive message
- Backups created before modifications (index.html.backup, styles-enhanced.css.backup)
- Repository ready for push to remote

## Current Status (In Progress)
- Random gallery showing white squares instead of images
- Debugging revealed images load briefly then disappear
- Mobile version not loading past initial page
- Applied several fixes (not yet committed):
  - Created symbolic link for image access
  - Disabled auto-refresh causing issues
  - Simplified gallery creation code
  - Removed problematic animations
  - Fixed image paths to use ../projects/ symlink

## Debugging Steps Taken
1. Created test pages (test-simple.html, debug-gallery.html)
2. Added console logging for image load/error events
3. Verified images exist and are accessible via symlink
4. Removed opacity animations that were hiding images
5. Simplified gallery code to eliminate complex transitions

## Next Steps
- Await user confirmation that gallery is working
- Commit fixes only after user approves working version
- Document final working solution
- Test on multiple devices and browsers

## Final Session Notes

### Critical Session Management System Created
- **SESSION_SEQUENCE.json** - Maintains true chronological order independent of server date/time
- **manage-sessions.js** - Tool for managing sessions with sequential numbering
- **SESSION_INDEX.md** - Quick reference for all sessions
- This system ensures continuity even with server date/time issues

### Important Reminders for Next Session
1. **DO NOT COMMIT** the current gallery fixes until user confirms they work
2. The gallery is showing white squares - images load briefly then disappear
3. Symbolic link created: `/root/Interiori/websites/projects` â†’ `/root/Interiori`
4. Test pages created: test-simple.html, debug-gallery.html, test-image.html

### Uncommitted Files (DO NOT LOSE THESE CHANGES)
- `/root/Interiori/websites/website1-minimalist/index.html` - Gallery fixes
- `/root/Interiori/websites/website1-minimalist/styles-enhanced.css` - CSS fixes
- Various test files for debugging

### Key Discoveries
1. Python HTTP server cannot serve files outside its root directory
2. Symbolic link solution allows access to project images
3. Auto-refresh was causing the white square issue
4. CSS animations were keeping images at opacity: 0

### User Requirements Emphasized
- Only website1-minimalist will be developed (all others archived)
- All instances must document their work in session summaries
- Changes must be tested and approved before committing
- Mobile performance is critical

### Current Gallery State
- Images path: `../projects/[folder]/[image]`
- Auto-refresh disabled
- Animations removed
- Simplified code structure
- Awaiting user testing and approval

## Session #3 Status: INCOMPLETE
The gallery issue remains unresolved. Next session should continue debugging.
