# Session Summary - 2025-07-01

## Overview
Continued from previous session where mobile optimization and language support were being implemented. Fixed critical JavaScript errors and completed Hebrew/Chinese language support.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed JavaScript Syntax Errors
- **File**: `/root/Interiori/websites/website1-minimalist/index.html` (lines 138-145)
- **Change**: Updated script references to use non-minified versions
- **Reason**: Minification process had broken JavaScript syntax in multiple files
- **Impact**: Resolved console errors and restored functionality

### 2. Created Image Path Fix Script
- **File**: `/root/Interiori/websites/fix-image-paths.js` (new file)
- **Purpose**: URL-encode special characters in image paths to prevent 404 errors
- **Features**:
  - Handles parentheses in filenames (e.g., "Vladi (1).jpg")
  - Encodes Cyrillic characters in folder names
  - Monitors dynamically loaded images
- **Integration**: Added to index.html line 13

### 3. Fixed Language Switcher localStorage Keys
- **File**: `/root/Interiori/websites/language-switcher-v2.js` (lines 4, 189)
- **Change**: Updated to use both 'selectedLanguage' and 'language' keys for compatibility
- **Impact**: Contact form now updates correctly when language changes

### 4. Fixed Translations.js Structure
- **File**: `/root/Interiori/websites/translations.js`
- **Issue**: Duplicate Bulgarian section (lines 1802-1938) and syntax errors
- **Fix**: Removed duplicate section, fixed closing braces
- **Result**: All 6 languages (EN, BG, RU, ES, HE, ZH) now load correctly

### 5. Created Test and Validation Scripts
- `/root/Interiori/websites/test-translations-debug.js` - Debug translations loading
- `/root/Interiori/websites/validate-translations.js` - Validate file structure
- `/root/Interiori/websites/fix-translations.js` - Analyze duplicate sections

## Testing Results
All language tests passing:
- English: ✓ Navigation and forms translate correctly
- Bulgarian: ✓ Full translation support
- Russian: ✓ Full translation support  
- Spanish: ✓ Full translation support
- Hebrew: ✓ RTL language working correctly
- Chinese: ✓ Character encoding working

## Pending Issues
- Minification needs to be redone with proper tools (currently using non-minified files)
- Some images with special characters may still need server-side configuration

## Next Steps
1. Implement proper JavaScript minification using terser or similar
2. Test image loading with encoded paths
3. Consider adding language-specific fonts for Hebrew/Chinese
4. Add RTL stylesheet for Hebrew language support
