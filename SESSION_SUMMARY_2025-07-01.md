# Session Summary - July 1, 2025

## Overview
Focused on fixing image loading issues in website1-minimalist and preparing it for standalone deployment.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Image Loading Issues
**Problem**: 9 out of 11 project cover images were failing to load in the browser despite being accessible on the server.

**Root Causes Identified**:
1. Missing URL encoding for folder names containing Cyrillic characters
2. Missing URL encoding for filenames containing parentheses
3. Conflict with `loading="lazy"` and `decoding="async"` attributes

**Solutions Implemented**:

#### File: `/root/Interiori/websites/website1-minimalist/dynamic-projects.js`
- **Line 5-7**: Added custom `encodeImagePath()` function to properly encode parentheses
- **Line 72**: Changed image src from `../${folderName}/${coverImage}` to `../${encodeImagePath(folderName)}/${encodeImagePath(coverImage)}`
- **Line 73-74**: Removed `loading="lazy"` and `decoding="async"` attributes that were causing load failures

#### File: `/root/Interiori/websites/website1-minimalist/index.html`
- **Line 9**: Added inline SVG favicon to prevent 404 errors
- **Line 15**: Commented out `fix-image-paths-simple.js` as it was causing double-encoding issues
- **Line 151-153**: Added `encodeImagePath()` function for random gallery
- **Line 177**: Updated random gallery image paths to use proper encoding

### 2. Deployment Preparation
Created deployment script: `/root/Interiori/websites/deploy-website1.sh`
- Packages website1-minimalist with all dependencies
- Copies all project image folders
- Updates relative paths for standalone deployment
- Creates tar.gz archive for easy deployment

### 3. Updated Minified Files
Ran `minify-assets.js` to update all minified versions with the fixes:
- `dynamic-projects.min.js`: 8191 → 5005 bytes (38.9% reduction)

## Test Results

### Before Fixes:
- Only 2 out of 11 project images loading
- Multiple 404 errors in console
- Inconsistent loading behavior

### After Fixes:
- All 11 project images loading successfully
- Only non-critical favicon 404 (now fixed with inline SVG)
- Language switcher functioning properly
- All projects displaying correctly

### Verified Working:
- ✓ All project cover images load
- ✓ Language switching (BG, EN, RU, ES, HE, ZH)
- ✓ Project gallery navigation
- ✓ Random gallery on homepage
- ✓ Mobile responsiveness
- ✓ No JavaScript errors

## Files Modified
1. `/root/Interiori/websites/website1-minimalist/dynamic-projects.js` - Fixed image path encoding
2. `/root/Interiori/websites/website1-minimalist/index.html` - Fixed random gallery encoding, added favicon
3. `/root/Interiori/websites/website1-minimalist/dynamic-projects.min.js` - Updated minified version
4. `/root/Interiori/websites/deploy-website1.sh` - Created deployment script

## New Files Created
1. `/root/Interiori/websites/deploy-website1.sh` - Deployment packaging script
2. `/root/Interiori/websites/website1-minimalist/favicon.ico` - Basic favicon file
3. Various test files for debugging (can be deleted)

## Deployment Ready
Website1-minimalist is now ready for standalone deployment. Run `./deploy-website1.sh` to create deployment package.

## Notes for Future Development
1. Avoid using `loading="lazy"` with dynamically loaded images that have special characters in paths
2. Always encode both folder names AND filenames when constructing image URLs
3. The `encodeURIComponent()` function does NOT encode parentheses by default - use custom encoding
4. Test with Cyrillic and special character filenames to ensure compatibility
