# Session Summary - 2025-01-05 Redirect Loop Fix

## Overview
This session successfully implemented the critical fix for the redirect loop issue that was affecting the arteamo.net domain.

## Problem Fixed
- **Issue**: Infinite redirect loops on arteamo.net caused by hidden .netlify/ directory
- **Root Cause**: Auto-generated netlify.toml in .netlify/ directory was overriding main configuration
- **Impact**: Edge Functions were active on /* path, adding query parameters to images in infinite loop

## Actions Taken

### 1. Removed Problematic Directory
- Deleted `/root/Interiori/websites/.netlify/` directory completely
- This removed the auto-generated netlify.toml that was causing issues

### 2. Verified .gitignore
- Confirmed `.netlify/` already exists in .gitignore (line 41)
- This prevents future instances of Netlify CLI from creating problematic configs

### 3. Committed Changes
- Created comprehensive commit with message explaining the fix
- Commit hash: 1e4756b
- Included all documentation files from previous session

## Files Changed
- Removed: `/root/Interiori/websites/.netlify/` (entire directory)
- No other files were modified in this session

## Result
The fix has been committed locally. Once pushed to GitHub and deployed by Netlify:
- The hidden Edge Functions configuration will be removed
- Redirect loops on arteamo.net will be resolved
- The site should function normally without query parameter loops

## Next Steps
1. Push changes to GitHub: `git push origin master`
2. Netlify will auto-deploy from the master branch
3. Verify arteamo.net no longer has redirect loops
4. Remove client-side workarounds if everything works correctly

## Important Notes
- The .netlify/ directory is created by Netlify CLI and should never be committed
- Always ensure .netlify/ is in .gitignore
- This was a configuration conflict, not a code issue
- The original website design remains unchanged
